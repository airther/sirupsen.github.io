title: 2015
---

While there's nothing special about the arbitrary time frame of a year it
provides a good time to do long-term reflection and goal-setting. 2015 has been
a great year. What I'm most proud of is building a solid exercise routine,
reading 40 books, becoming confident in public speaking and improving nutrition
significantly. Every year, I strive to make it better than the last, which has
been successful for the past 5 years.  These numbers, of course, only capture a
small part of the story.  The number or percentage change in parenthesis is
compared to last year.
